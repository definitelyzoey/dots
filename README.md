# Dots
dots for my linux mint i3 setup C:

## Overview
- Distro: Linux Mint
- Discord Client: Equicord
- WM: i3wm
- Terminal: kitty
- Composer: picom
- App Launcher: rofi
- Bar: Polybar
- File Manager: ranger
- Terminal Apps: cava, pipes, cmatrix, kew, hyfetch (custom alias for ascii)

## Note
This is my configurations for my needs, I have commented out anything that wont work straight away (e.g. launch saved workspace layouts)
Files such as workspace layouts and start sctipts will be included so you can use the same layout in the screenshots.
> MAKE Sure you edit/change the apps in load_layout_foo.sh and in the workspace_foo.json to the apps you want to auto launch there. (foo being workspace number/name)
> If you are confused or lost about saving workplace layouts, read threw this [i3 doc](https://i3wm.org/docs/layout-saving.html), also [arch wiki](https://wiki.archlinux.org/title/I3#Save_and_restore_the_window_layout) has info on it.
